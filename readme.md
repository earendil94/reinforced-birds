## Reinforced birds

** This code is still under development **

Using MultiAgent reinforcement learning, we seek to solve a pursuit-evasion problem between a chasing bird (pursuer) and some fleeing birds (evaders). In particular, we are interested in any non-trivial collective behaviour emerging spontaneously from the simulation. 

This is the code for my thesis work at ICTP, working together with professor Antonio Celani and with Emanuele Panizon.

## How to use this code

Easy:

    git clone https://github.com/earendil94/reinforced-evasion.git
    cd ./reinforced-evasion
    make
    ./main.x

This will launch a training with 10 birds with the default configuration defined in the main.cpp file.

You can find further explanation about the project directly in the comment in main.cpp
